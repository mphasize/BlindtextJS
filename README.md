BlindtextJS
==========


BlindtextJS is a simple solution to fill your website templates with some placeholder text. It's easy, flexible and it's free!


How does it work?
-----------------

In order to keep your website templates clean, we use standard techniques to insert und manage dummy text directly inside your templates.

So, all you need to do is load our small Javascript and then you can start using the following syntax in your HTML documents to insert dummy text:

	<blindtext>

Done! Yep, it's that easy! ;-) You need more options? Try...

	<blindtext length="500">
	
	<blindtext lang="en">
	
	<blindtext length="500" lang="de">
	

Well, BlindtextJS is in the very early stages of development. Which means:

- for now we rely on jQuery to help with the replacement
- functionality is currently very limited, but we have a few ideas

Known Issues
------------

- dummy text is cut off really ugly, when the character limit is reached
- only Lorem Ipsum text available by now, but we would actually like to support different languages

Feedback appreciated!
---------------------

If you have any ideas you'd like to be incorporated, please take the time and drop us a note!
